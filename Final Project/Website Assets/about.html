I have been someone who has always been highly interested in technology. One of my favorite things to do with my spare time is to play video games. Here is a list of some of my current favorites.</p>

    <li class="games">League of Legends</li>
    <li class="games">World of Warcraft</li>
    <li class="games">The Binding of Isaac</li>
  </ol>
