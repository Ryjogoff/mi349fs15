  <p>Welcome to my website portfolio! I have created this website as a final project for my MI 349 class. I decided to go for a very minimalistic view on my website design as I find it very pleasing to view and it is my favorite style. On this website I have included a few pages about who I am, a link to my resume, and for fun I included some of my favorite records from my record collection. If you would like to contact me you can do do that by emailing by using the following link: <a href="mailto:goffrya1@msu.edu" target="_top">goffrya1@msu.edu</a></p>
