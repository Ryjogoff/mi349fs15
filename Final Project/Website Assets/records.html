  <p>I really enjoy listening to music a lot and as a result I started collecting vinyl records as a fun hobby. My collection began to grow rather rapidly at first and has since slowed down. I have collected many difference albums from many different genres over the past couple years. Over this time I have collected a few albums that I would consider my favorite for a multitude of reasons such as being a generally great album or even for the album art. I have collected a list of some of my favorites and have included them in a list here with a picture of their album art as well.</p>
